# Facebook Post Modification Addon

This is a chrom(ium) browser extention to monitor and modify Facebook posts based on certain criteria.

## Primary Objective:
When a Facebook post contains the word "server" (regardless of its casing, i.e., "Server" or "server"), the script will replace the content of that post with a predefined, informative message about Capybaras.

## Functionality Breakdown:

### Post Selection:
The script begins by selecting Facebook post elements based on specific DOM attributes. The criteria used focuses on posts having a non-empty id attribute within a div container that has a dir attribute set to "auto".

### Criteria Check:
For each identified post, the script checks if the content contains the word "server" in any form, either uppercase or lowercase.

### Content Modification:
If a post meets the criteria, the script clears the content of all associated text containers. It then sets the content of the first text container to an educational message about Capybaras. The purpose here is to replace potentially unwanted content with something fun and informative.

### Content Monitoring:
Besides the immediate modification upon document loading, the script uses a MutationObserver to continuously monitor changes to the document. This ensures that even if new posts are loaded onto the page (like when scrolling through the feed), the script will still inspect and modify them based on the set criteria.

### End Result:
Any Facebook post mentioning "server" will be replaced with a message that talks about Capybaras enjoying hot springs, aiming to provide a delightful and wholesome diversion from the original content.

## Additional info:
It should be easy to modify the code to enable checking for a list of words and also using a list of sentences to replace the contents, so more facts about capybaras are possible.

Facebooks code constantly changes and using CSS-Selectors therefore might be a bad idea because it could break pretty often.
